                        <dd>I love gaming because I grew up with it when I was younger, about 4 years old (thats when I
                            had a conscious). My father showed me one of the call of duty game, he taught me how to play
                            it and as I grew older I played other games with my father. He left for texas a while back
                            but because of him I just love the concept of gaming and how fun it can be.</dd>

                        <dd>I also love playing chess, I forgot how I got into it but I had so much fun with it. Me and
                            grandpa would go toe to toe, winning and losing against each other, I also tried to get
                            other friends to play as well or at least learn it but none ever did, I was also in a chess
                            club but since the clube president didn't come we didn't have a meeting for chess and he was
                            really good, I couldn't beat him or my uncle. Now a days I don't see that much people who
                            are interested in chess and it's kind of disappointing but it's still fun</dd>
